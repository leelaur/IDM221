                <p>  Hi! I’m Lauren, I am a creative problem solver interested in understanding how things work and how it can be better.
                    I am a sophomore at Drexel University as part of the five-year program for 
                    User Experience and Interaction Design (B.S.). I became interested in user experience 
                    design through an informational session during the college process when I first heard of the term “UX”. 
                    I was intrigued by how one could be so versatile in a position like UX, using the creative process to develop a proper and enjoyable experience; that intrigue has led me to Drexel University’s UXID (user experience & interaction design) program.
                    <br> Although I am most interested in UX, I am also pursuing some of my other passions including filmmaking, which I am currently minoring in. Since I was a child, I was always fascinated with visual storytelling and the way it made me feel. I hope to become a better storyteller that can evoke powerful emotions within my work in and outside of filmmaking.
                    When I am not creating or designing, you can find me jamming to Pitbull’s “Time of Our Lives”, watching movies from my top 100 best movies scratch-off poster, or watering my plants.
