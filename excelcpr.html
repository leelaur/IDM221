        <h3> <i>Task: </i> design a logo for Excel CPR. </h3>
       <section>
         <h4> Introduction</h4>
            <p> 
            Excel CPR is a local business that started offering classes for certification in first aid and CPR through the American Heart Association in 2020. I was given the opportunity to create a logo that would represent the business.

                <p>
                    To begin, I started sketching out ideas on paper. I knew I wanted the logo to represent a heart or a heartbeat because CPR is used to revive someone whose
                    heart stops beating. Many of my sketches below play with a single heartbeat pulse crossing through the word “Excel”.

            I took two iterations I found interesting in my sketchbook and developed it more on Adobe Illustrator.

                After showing these two options to my client, they preferred option 2. Some things they liked about it were the heart at the end of the pulse and how the pulse extends out. 
                An issue with this design was that I had hand-drawn it using a mouse, which did not look neat. So I continued to push the idea with other sketches.

            <p> I came up with the idea to put the heartbeat inside the heart, which wasn’t very original seeing as how every CPR business had the same idea. So to make it look different 
            I made the heart and the extending line out of a singular line as shown in the image above. The name “Excel CPR” would go above and below the line rather than it just looking like the text on a line. 
            I used the font “Good Headline Pro” and made the heart shape red as an eye-popping 
            color that is associated with the heart. My final design:

            This is the first logo I have ever created so it was a new experience. I wasn’t formally taught how to make a logo so I went by my own design process which has its 
            advantages and disadvantages. Overall, it is very rewarding to have my design being used on business cards and websites, but also seeing how much the logo has evolved brings me satisfaction.
