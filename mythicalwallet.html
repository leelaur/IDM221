    <h3>Task: Design a wallet that associates with the mythical creature, the gnome. </h3>
<div>
    <h4>Research</h4>
    <p>
    Before I could start creating, I did research on the two subjects, wallet and gnome, to find a relationship where I can draw a connection.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h4>Key takeaways:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li> The first wallet was used to carry coins but evolved to carry paper currency in 1980, and evolved again to carry cards in the 20th century </li>
        <li> Most wallets were designed to fit in your pocket</li>
        <li> Gnomes protect treasure hidden underground where they live </li>
        <li> Gnomes are known to be guardians of the earth </li>
    </ul>

I also got first hand research from observing how people interacted with their wallets while working at Dunkin Donuts. <br />

*Some Observations:* <br />

- People take swift motions to get out money and return to pocket
- Most people used bi-fold wallets
- Most people would just shove change into pocket
- I created a story board of the steps in which people used their wallet. <br />

*Things I want to address from my observations and research:* <br />

- An easy way to fit in pocket
- A quick way to take out and put in money
