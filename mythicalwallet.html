            Research
        </h4>
            <p>
                Before I could start creating, I did research on the two subjects, wallet and gnome, to find a relationship where I can draw a connection.
            </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Key takeaways:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> The first wallet was used to carry coins but evolved to carry paper currency in 1980, and evolved again to carry cards in the 20th century </li>
            <li> Most wallets were designed to fit in your pocket</li>
            <li> Gnomes protect treasure hidden underground where they live </li>
            <li> Gnomes are known to be guardians of the earth </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p> 
            I also got first hand research from observing how people interacted with their wallets while working at Dunkin Donuts. 
            <br> Some Observations:
            <ul>
                <li> People take swift motions to get out money and return to pocket</li>
                <li> Most people used bi-fold wallets </li>
                <li>Most people would just shove change into pocket </li>
            </ul> 
            I created a story board of the steps in which people used their wallet. 
            <!--add image-->
            <br> Things I want to address from my observations: 
            <ul>
                <li> An easy way to fit in pocket</li>
                <li>A quick way to take out and put in money</li>
            </ul>
